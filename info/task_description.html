<p>
    You are given a list of points on a coordinate plane.
    We need you to find the convex hull formed by these points.
    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of an X set of points
    in the Euclidean plane is the smallest convex set that contains X.
    For instance: when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape
    formed by a rubber band stretched around X. If a point lies on edge, it's included.
</p>

<p>
    The points are presented as a list of coordinates [x, y] in which x and y are the integers.
    The result returns as a sequence of points indexes in the given list; points lie on the convex hull in a clockwise
    order (see the picture).
    The sequence starts from the bottom leftmost point.
    Remember: You should return a list of indexes--not the points themselves.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Convex hulls have practical applications in pattern recognition, image processing,
    statistics, GIS and static code analysis by abstract interpretation.
    The concept also serves as a tool and a building block for a number of other computational-geometric algorithms
    such as the rotating calipers method for computing the width and diameter of a point set.
